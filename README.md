# Embedding_Generator
Multi-Modal Embedding Generator is a unified platform designed to generate embeddings from text, images, and audio in a single, integrated solution. The system uses a Remix-based frontend paired with a FastAPI backend, combining both cloud-based (Azure OpenAI) and on-premise (Fastembed, Groq) technologies.
